#  Viewing and Understanding Elementary Artifacts

Now that we have downloaded the Elementary package, let’s understand its impact on our data. When we use ****************dbt run,**************** Elementary will generate a number of new artifacts in our database. These artifacts are used by Elementary for anomaly detection and testing.

To generate these artifacts use: 

    dbt run

These artifacts are used by Elementary tests and the Elementary CLI and will be updated when we run **********************dbt run********************** and ********************dbt test********************.

Next, let’s see how we add Elementary tests and anomaly detection to our data.
