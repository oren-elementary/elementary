title: "Setup tutorial environment"
---

In this step you will setup the environment needed for running the tutorial and using Elementary.

## Before you start

<Info> 
  
  **Prerequisites**

For the tutorial you will need:

1. Working Python installation
2. [pip installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python
3. Access and credentials to a data warehouse supported by Elementary

We also recommend you work with a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

## Setup tutorial dbt project

<Accordion title="dbt core">

#### 1. Create Elementary tutorial dbt project

We created a dbt project to help us with the tutorial.
The project is an extended version of the [dbt "jaffle shop" project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop).
It contains seeds and models that we will use to run Elementary's tests on, and collect arrtifacts.

In order to use the tutorial project, you can either clone the project, or initial a new project and copy the relevant files from the tutorial project.

<Accordion title="Clone Elementary tutorial dbt project">

#### 1. Clone Elementary tutorial dbt project

To clone the tutorial project run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elementary-data/tutorial.git
```

#### 2. Create profile for elementary_tutorial dbt project

Create a profile for `elementary_tutorial` at your `profiles.yml`

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Initial Elementary tutorial dbt project">

#### 1. Initial dbt project

To initial the tutorial project run the following command:

```shell
dbt init elementary_tutorial
```

#### 2. Add models to the dbt project

After we initialized the tutorial dbt project, we want to add the relevant files to the project:

- seeds: copy the folders from the [tutorial repo seeds folder](https://github.com/elementary-data/tutorial/tree/main/seeds) to your tutorial dbt project seeds folder.
- models: copy the folders from the [tutorial repo models folder](https://github.com/elementary-data/tutorial/tree/main/models) to your tutorial dbt project models folder. Notice that the `schema.yml` file is already defineds with all of the tutorial models (without the tests).

#### 3. Add elementary dbt package to the project

We want to add elementary to our dbt project. To do so add the following lines to the `packages.yml` file:

```yaml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: [">=0.5.3", "<1.0.0"]
```

#### Define schema for elementary

Elementary requires to define a schema for it. We should add the following lines to our `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml
models:
  elementary:
    +schema: "elementary"
```

</Accordion>

#### 2. Seed the tutorial data

Run deps to install the tutorial dbt project packages:

```shell
dbt deps
```

Run seed to seed the tutorial data into the warehouse

```shell
dbt seed
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="dbt cloud">

#### 1. Fork Elementary tutorial repo

We created a dbt project to help us with the tutorial.
The project is an extended version of the [dbt "jaffle shop" project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop).
It contains seeds and models that we will use to run Elementary's tests on, and collect arrtifacts.

In order to load the tutorial project into your dbt cloud, you need to fork the repo and connect a new project to it.

To fork the the tutorial repo, go to the [tutorial repo](https://github.com/elementary-data/tutorial) and click on the `fork` button.

To create a new project at your dbt cloud, go to `Account Settings` and click on the `New Project` button under the `Projects` section.

<Info>

Make sure you name your profile `elementary_tutorial`.

</Info>

#### 2. Seed the tutorial data

Run deps to install the tutorial dbt project packages:

```shell
dbt deps
```

Run seed to seed the tutorial data into the warehouse

```shell
dbt seed
```

</Accordion>

## Setup Elementary CLI

<Accordion title="dbt core">

#### 1. Install Elementary CLI

To install Elementary CLI, run the following command:

```shell
pip install elementary-data
```

#### 2. Create profile for Elementary CLI

If we want to run Elementary's report over our tutorial project, we should create a dbt profile for elementary.

To create a profile easily, run the following command:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Copy the output, fill in the missing fields and add the profile to your `profiles.yml`.

You can see the full guide for configure Elementary profile [here](/quickstart-cli).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="dbt cloud">

#### 1. Install Elementary CLI

Elementary CLI is a python package that works outside of dbt cloud.
Because of that, in order to run Elementary CLI, we need to install it using python on our local machine.

To install Elementary CLI, run the following command:

```shell
pip install elementary-data
```

#### 2. Create profile for Elementary CLI

If we want to run Elementary's report over our tutorial project, we should create a dbt profile for elementary.

To create a profile easily, run the following command in your dbt cloud tutorial project:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Copy the output, fill in the missing fields and create a `profiles.yml` file in your local machine with it.

<Info>

Remember where you saved your `profiles.yml` file, we will use it later when we will run Elementary CLI.

</Info>

You can see the full guide for configure Elementary profile [here](/quickstart-cli).
