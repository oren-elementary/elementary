Elementary integrates with dbt core (1.0.0 and above) and dbt cloud, as long as the data warehouse is supported.

Both dbt core and cloud users need to [deploy the dbt package](/quickstart) first in the monitored project.

### dbt core

After deploying the dbt package, use [this guide](/quickstart-cli) to install the CLI, and add an `elementary` profile.

When you [deploy to production](/deployment-and-configuration/elementary-in-production), you could orchestrate the CLI on the same system you use for running dbt core.

### dbt cloud

After deploying the dbt package, you will need to create a `profiles.yml` file on the machine you are using to run Elementary.
This file contains the connection details for the CLI to access your DWH.

Use to create the profile, [this guide](/quickstart-cli) install the CLI, and run it.

<ConnectionProfile />

<ProfilePermissions />
